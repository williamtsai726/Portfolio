          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Wei-Chuan Tsai was born in Taiwan and studied in mainland China before college. He graduated from the <a href="https://www.i-s-d.org/">International
            School of Dongguan</a> in 2022 with an IB diploma. Wei-Chuan is currently a second year student in the University of Washington and he is pursuing
            a Bachelor's degree in the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering department. </p>
          <p>Wei-Chuan is interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Robotics, and hardware. Currently, he is thinking about diving into the field of hardware optimization
            for machine learning algorithms. In simple terms, investigate what kinds of hardware best fit a specific ML algorithm and then maximize the precision of individual
            algorithm by putting together the most suitable computer. Because of this, Wei-Chuan intends to transfer to Computer Engineer major so he can study both software and
            hardware.

              <p>Mobile applications that serve to classify flowers have been developed and this project aimed to simulate that classification functionality.
                Dataset of 102 types of flowers was taken from Kaggle and used to train the Convolutional neural network, which was expected to have the ability to classify
                102 different types of flowers among the data.

                signs taken at high speed to train the Convolutional neural network and test its accuracy. The model was then improved using Augmentation, Transfering and fine-tuning
                with VGG16.

              <p>This project used the latest U.S. influenza dataset from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to build RNN, LSTM, and GRU models and predict the influenza trends.
                The resulting predictions was then used to analyze and compare the effectiveness of individual models. The goal was to investigate which algorithm is better in solving this kind
                of linear regression problems.
